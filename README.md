# Product Revenue Analysis

This project calculates the total revenue of each product at each price based on two sample datasets provided: `price.csv` and `sales.csv`. These datasets contain records of product price changes and sales in September 2018.

## Problem Statement

The task is to calculate the total revenue generated by each product at each price point. This solution must be scalable and applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.

## Dataset Description

- `price.csv`: Records of product price changes in September 2018.
- `sales.csv`: Records of product sales in September 2018.

### Data Fields

- **price.csv**:
  - `product_id`: ID of the product.
  - `old_price`: Old price of the product.
  - `new_price`: New price of the product.
  - `update_at`: Date of the price change.

- **sales.csv**:
  - `product_id`: ID of the product.
  - `ordered_at`: Date of the order.
  - `quantity_ordered`: Quantity of the product sold.

## Solution Approach

The solution involves:
1. Reading and preprocessing the datasets.
2. Joining the datasets on the `product_id` field.
3. Grouping the data by `product_id` and `price`.
4. Calculating the total revenue for each product at each price.
5. Outputting the results.
